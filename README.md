P6. HealthMetrics Visualization 
A mobile application that collects daily activities to assist users to reach their fitness goals, such as perform 
activities in regular intervals (e.g., every 3 hours), lose weight, increase overall physical activities, etc. You 
can use historical/sample data rather than actual data. The data must be visualized in a meaningful way 
and interactive so that users can understand the data and tap on it to acquire more information.
